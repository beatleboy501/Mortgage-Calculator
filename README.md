## Mortgage Calculator
<hr>
I built a small Mortgage Calculator with an amortization table using ECMAScript 6 features.
It uses Babel as well as Webpack to transpile the ES6 code and run in current browsers.
There is a tutorial on how to build this Calculator here - [here](http://ccoenraets.github.io/es6-tutorial).
